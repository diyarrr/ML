Iris Dataset
The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It consists of measurements of different attributes of Iris flowers belonging to three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. This dataset is often used as a beginner's dataset for learning classification algorithms.

Content
The dataset contains the following columns:

Sepal Length: The length of the sepal (in centimeters).
Sepal Width: The width of the sepal (in centimeters).
Petal Length: The length of the petal (in centimeters).
Petal Width: The width of the petal (in centimeters).
Species: The species of the Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica).
Usage
The Iris dataset can be used for various purposes, including:

Classification: The dataset is commonly used to train and evaluate classification algorithms. Given the measurements of the attributes, the goal is to predict the correct species of an Iris flower.

Exploratory Data Analysis: The dataset can be used to explore relationships and patterns between the different attributes of the flowers. Visualizations and statistical analysis can provide insights into the characteristics of each species.

License
The Iris dataset is available under the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is distributed with the UCI Machine Learning Repository terms of use.
